-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to my personal website.

The language used to program the website is [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/ "Hugo Oficial Language Website"), a fast and flexible static site generator written in go.

I made this website to congregate in a single site all my knowledge and personal info in order to, in one hand create a space where i can express myself and estructure my thoughts and ideas. And in the other hand, as a professional portfolio to showcase my works which is sometimes hard to do in a single CV file.

I consider myself a tech and computer enthusiast with a dificult to evade eager to learn new things. This results in a unorganized and easy to forget the past knowledge learn due to new things coming in to fill the gap. As a solution, i build this website to manage this caos and bring it under control with the power of Markdown, Neovim, git and other technologies.
